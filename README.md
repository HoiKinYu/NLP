2022-07-22 Uploaded ***Similarity Search - Facebook AI  Faiss - Twitter Airline Dataset 220722.ipynb***

***Executive Summary:***

***What is Facebook AI Similarity Search (Faiss)?***

- Faiss is a library developed by Facebook AI â€” that enables ***efficient similarity search***.

- Given a set of vectors, we can index them using Faiss

- Using another vector (the query vector), we ***search for the most similar vectors within the index***.

Twitter Airline Dataset originally came from: https://appen.com/pre-labeled-datasets/
